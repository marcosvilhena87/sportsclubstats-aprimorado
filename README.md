# Brasileirão Simulator

This project provides a simple simulator for the 2025 Brasileirão Série A season. It parses the fixtures provided in `data/Brasileirao2025A.txt`, builds a league table from played matches and simulates the remaining games many times to estimate title and relegation probabilities.

## Usage

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run the simulator:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --simulations 1000
```

Matches are simulated purely at random with all teams considered equal.

The script outputs the estimated chance of winning the title for each team. It then prints the probability of each side finishing in the bottom four and being relegated. It also estimates the average final position and points of every club.

## Tie-break Rules

When building the league table teams are ordered using the official Série A criteria:

1. Points
2. Number of wins
3. Goal difference
4. Goals scored
5. Points obtained in the games between the tied sides
6. Team name (alphabetical)

These rules are implemented in :func:`league_table` and therefore affect all simulation utilities.

## Project Layout

- `data/` – raw fixtures and results.
- `src/brasileirao/simulator.py` – parsing, table calculation and simulation routines.
- `main.py` – command-line interface to run the simulation.
- `tests/` – basic unit tests.

The main functions can be imported directly from the package:

```python
from brasileirao import (
    parse_matches,
    league_table,
    simulate_chances,
    simulate_relegation_chances,
    simulate_final_table,
)
```
